# Projected refractive index framework for phase retrieval
**Authors:** [Yunhui Gao](https://github.com/Yunhui-Gao) (gyh21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) and Liangcai Cao (clc@tsinghua.edu.cn)

## Requirements

* **Matlab:** 2019a or newer. Older visions may be sufficient but have not been tested. 
* **OS:** Win 10 or newer (if using PUMA for phase unwrapping).

## Quick Start
Run `demo_sim.m` with default parameters.
